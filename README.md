# VQNN-Framework-for-Electric-Contact-Phenomena
In this study we present a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (Variational Quantum Algorithm) for modeling and solving Heat and Mass transfer problems occurring in Electric Contacts. The underlying Equations responsible for modeling diverse electric contact phenomena like arcing, bridging, welding etc. are Stefan Type Problems. These problems are nonlinear and hard to solve analytically. We build a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network for modeling and solving such kind Heat and Mass transfer problems. We benefit from computational power of Quantum Computing to solve the Stefan Type problems and utilize neural network as a universal function approximator for the Heat function and Moving Phase boundary. On the base of the Variational Quantum Neural Network, we develop an industry ready software which might be of interest and beneficial for engineers working in the field of modeling electric contact phenomena. Proposed framework and artifact are beyond the field of modeling and solving Heat and Mass transfer problems occurring in electric contacts and can be applied in diverse phase transient phenomena like tumor growth and spreading (Biomedicine), material deformation and failure under stress (Materials Science) etc.
